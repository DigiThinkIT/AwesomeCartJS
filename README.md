## Awesome Cart JS

A simplified shopping cart front end javascript library. Awc does not have a backend, instead it relies on adapters to fetch products and place orders.
The goal of Awc is to quickly deploy a shopping cart front end with little to no changes to your existing website code base while maintaining modern cart flexibility on any page you would like to sell a product from.

### Getting Started

Awc requires at least one empty element in your page which it will use to feed
products listing.

So, somewhere in your page add an empty element and give it an ID:

~~~~html
<div id="products"></div>
~~~~

Next include the library close to the bottom of your page:

~~~~html
<script src="js/awc.standalone.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
~~~~

Finally define the product feed and bootstrap the cart.

~~~~html
<script type="text/javascript">

  // create a cart instance
  var cart = new awc.AwesomeCart()

  // A product feed is an automated way of fetching product listings from a
  // previously defined data store. The default data store is the included
  // DemoStoreaAdapter class
  cart.newProductFeed('products', {
    container: '#products',
    product_template: awc.getTemplate('product_template.html') // define a handlebars template location
  })

  // kickoff the cart logic
  cart.bootstrap()
</script>
~~~~

### Product Templates

AWC uses the handlebars templating library to ease building of product listings.
You can simply reference a template using awc.getTemplate() function to define what
template to use when a product feed is being refreshed.

As of this time the template context is the same object as received from the store adapter:

~~~~json
{
  "sku": "Product SKU",
  "name": "Product Name",
  "description": "Product Description",
  "price": 100,
  "tags": ["tag1", "tag2", "etc..."]
}
~~~~

### adapters

If you don't provide an adapter instance during the creation of awc a DemoStoreAdapter instance will be created and assigned to your cart instance.
